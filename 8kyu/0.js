// Task
// Remove First and Last Character

// It's pretty straightforward.
// Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string.
// You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with
// less than two characters.

// Solution:

function removeChar(str){
    return str.slice(1, -1)
};
